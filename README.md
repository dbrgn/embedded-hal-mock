This is a collection of types that implement the embedded-hal traits.

The implementations never access real hardware. Instead, the hardware is mocked
or no-op implementations are used.

The goal of the crate is to be able to test drivers in CI without having access
to hardware.

This crate requires Rust 1.31+!
