_(Note: This create currently targets the latest stable version of embedded-hal.
If you're looking for a version that's compatible with the 1.0.0 alpha of
embedded-hal, check out the [`1-alpha`
branch](https://github.com/dbrgn/embedded-hal-mock/tree/1-alpha).)_

This is a collection of types that implement the embedded-hal traits.

The implementations never access real hardware. Instead, the hardware is mocked
or no-op implementations are used.

The goal of the crate is to be able to test drivers in CI without having access
to hardware.

[Docs](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-mock/)
