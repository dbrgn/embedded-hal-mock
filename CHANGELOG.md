## 0.10.0 - 2024-01-10

This release contains a big change: `embedded-hal-mock` now supports both
`embedded-hal` 0.x and 1.x! The two variants are accessible through
`embedded_hal_mock::eh0::*` and `embedded_hal_mock::eh1::*`. If there are any
issues, leave feedback in the GitHub issue tracker.

Additionally, tests now fail if you forgot to call `.done()`. This should
reduce the chance of accidentally writing a broken test.

This release contains commits by 12 different people, thanks a lot for the
contributions!

### Migrating to 0.10.0

- Update your imports: Change `use embedded_hal_mock::*` to
  `use embedded_hal_mock::eh0::*`
- Rename all `.expect(...)` calls on mocks to `.update_expectations(...)`
- Rename all `eh0::delay::MockNoop` usages to `eh0::delay::NoopDelay`
- Run your tests to ensure that you don't have any missing `.done()` calls in
  your code
- Look through the rest of the changes below and check if they might affect
  your code

### Added

- Support for both `embedded-hal` 0.x and 1.x in the same crate (#75)
- Print a warning to stderr and fail test if a mock is dropped without having
  calling `.done()` on it, or if `.done()` is called twice (#59, #61)
- Implement mock for `eh1::pwm::SetDutyCycle`

### Fixed

- `Generic` mock: Fix a bug that caused the call to `.done()` to fail if
  `.next()` was called on the mock after all expectations have already been
  consumed (#58)
- Fix assertion error message for SPI `transfer` and ` transfer_in_place` (#90)

### Changed

- Renamed `.expect(...)` method to `.update_expectations(...)` to avoid
  confusion with the expect method in `Option` and `Result` (#63)
- When updating expectations on a mock by calling `.expect(...)` /
  `.update_expectations(...)` on it, assert that previous expectations have
  been consumed (#63)
- Rename `delay::MockNoop` to `delay::NoopDelay`.
- Changed the eh1 SPI implementation to be generic over word size
- Updated `nb` dependency from 0.1 to 1.1 (#107)
- Bump minimal supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63 (or 1.75 if you use
  embedded-hal 1.0)
- The minimal supported Rust version (MSRV) is specified in the `Cargo.toml` to
  offer clearer error messages to consumers with outdated Rust versions


## 0.9.0 - 2023-01-07

### Added

- Add mock for timers using embedded-time with nanosecond precision (#40)

### Changed

- Bump minimal supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.60
- Switch to Rust 2021 edition (#55)

## 0.7.0 - 2019-05-22

### Added

- The serial transaction API now has two new constructor methods: `read_many`
  and `write_many`.

### Changed

- The serial transaction API changed: The `Transaction::write` function now
  expects a single word, not a collection of words. To add a transaction for
  many writes, use `Transaction::write_many` instead.

### Fixed

- Make the serial mock actually cloneable
